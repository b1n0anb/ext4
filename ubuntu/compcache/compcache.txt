compcache: Compressed RAM based swap device
-------------------------------------------

Project home: http://code.google.com/p/compcache

* Introduction
This is a RAM based block device which acts as swap disk.
Pages swapped to this device are compressed and stored in
memory itself.

It uses these components:
 - TLSF: memory allocator
 - LZO: de/compressor

* Usage
 - modprobe compcache compcache_size_kbytes=<size>
   (If no size is specified, default size of 25% of RAM is taken).
 - swapon /dev/ramzswap0

* Notes
 - Allocator and compcache statistics are exported via /proc interface:
   (if stats are enabled for corresponding modules)
   - /proc/tlsfinfo (from tlsf.ko)
   - /proc/compcache (from compcache.ko)
