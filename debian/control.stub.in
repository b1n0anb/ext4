Description: Linux kernel source for version PKGVER with Ubuntu patches
 This package provides the source code for the Linux kernel version
 PKGVER.
 .
 This package is mainly meant for other packages to use, in order to build
 custom flavours.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then it
 is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package, which has
 been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image packages.
 .
 If you are simply trying to build third-party modules for your kernel,
 you do not want this package. Install the appropriate linux-headers
 package instead.

Description: Linux kernel specific documentation for version PKGVER
 This package provides the various readme's in the PKGVER kernel
 Documentation/ subdirectory: these typically contain kernel-specific
 installation notes for some drivers for example. See
 /usr/share/doc/linux-doc-PKGVER/Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what
 is contained in each file.  Please read the Changes file, as it contains
 information about the problems, which may result by upgrading your
 kernel.

Description: Linux Kernel Headers for development
 This package provides headers from the Linux kernel.  These headers
 are used by the installed headers for GNU glibc and other system
 libraries. They are NOT meant to be used to build third-party modules for
 your kernel. Use linux-headers-* packages for that.
